# This script STARTS the OpenVPN client. This is done as follows:
#
# 1. Disable the NATing that could be in place between wlan0 (Access point) and wlan1 and eth1
#
# 2. Starts the OpenVPN client
#
# 3. puts NATing (ip masquerading) in place
#
# 4. Optional: enables port forwarding through the NAT to make services available to the outside
#    world that are running on a device behind the NAT.
